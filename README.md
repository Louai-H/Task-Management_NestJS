# [Task Management](http://task-management-frontend-react.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/)

A full-stack app created to allow users to manage their tasks by creating their own accounts and storing their tasks, change and monitor task statuses.  
The app authorizes users to sign-in to a task management dashboard, where they can add and remove tasks, update task status to OPEN, IN PROGRESS, DONE and allow them to search/filter tasks.  
Back-End: Node.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL with TypeORM, AWS (Amazon Web Services) and RDS (Amazon Relational Database Service).  
Front-End: React

## Why NestJS

I love TypeScript, I come from an Angular background, and I love Node.js for the backend for the web. NestJS is a TypeScript Framework that looks like Angular for the backend, it provides solutions and an organized framework to build scalable and secure server-side applications.  
It uses Express under the hood and is flexible to customize, and has many out of the box built in solutions.
